# Lexeter via Godot

This is a recreation of my partially finished Lexeter project(found at https://github.com/users/TriusMalarky/projects/3) in the Godot(https://godotengine.org)
game engine. Same soul, different environment. This was done largely because I wanted better graphical interface control.

This repository contains the Godot project file. To access it, run the Godot engine, and using the Import function, select the "project.godot" file inside
lexeterviagodot/Lexeter .
